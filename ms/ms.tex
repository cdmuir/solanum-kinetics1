\section{notes}\label{notes}

Reminder: Halliwell et al.~2025 paper has useful info on multiresponse
models. I might use Van de Pol and Wright (2009) method for within
versus between slope estimation. This is in the phylogenetic comparative
example in the brms vignette too. Actually, this is hard to implement
because I would have to calculate individual residuals for each light
treatment combination and then means of those, etc.

Westoby et al (2023) (10.1111/1365-2745.14150) is similar to Halliwell.
Maybe another way to think about it using the mutliresponse approach.

\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Guard cell size and stomatal density vary over X and X orders of
magnitude among extant vascular land plants, yet the adaptive
significance of much of this variation remains unclear. The evolution of
guard cell size in particular is poorly understood and may even be
constrained by nonadaptive features like genome size. One hypothesis is
that natural selection may favor smaller guard cells to increase the
rate at which stomatal conductance responds to fluctuating environmental
conditions. A related hypothesis is that operational stomatal
conductance (gop) is often \(\approx 25\%\) of its theoretical maximum
(gmax) because at this stomatal aperture, guard cell volume is poised to
change rapidly with changes in turgor pressure. The support for both
hypothesis is limited and mixed, in part because they have not been
tested together, even though both guard cell size and the ratio of gop
to gmax (gop:gmax) should influence stomatal kinetics. We measured
stomatal closure kinetics in response to an abrupt increase in vapor
pressure deficit (VPD) among 29 diverse wild tomato populations in the
genus \textit{Solanum}. Both smaller guard cell size and lower gop:gmax
were associated with faster stomatal closure kinetics, but at different
levels of biological organization. Guard cell size explained X\% of the
variance in stomatal kinetics among populations, whereas gop:gmax
explained X\% of the variance among individuals within populations.
{[}neither result would have been supported if analyzed in isolation -
is this true?{]}. We conclude that guard cell size may respond to
selection on stomatal kinetics over evolutionary time, but actual
kinetics are modulated by a tradeoff between maximizing gop and
minimizing the time required for stomatal closure. Putting these
hypotheses together with stabilizing selection on gop may explain why
stomatal size and density negatively covary among species.

Maybe add something like: we esimated time-constant and lag-time for
2000+ curves\ldots{}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

NOTE: I need to develop a consistent terminology - stomatal response
rate? speed? kinetics?

In nature, change is the only constant. One way that vascular plants
(tracheophytes) cope with change is by adjusting stomatal pore aperture
to optimize the trade-off between carbon gain and water loss. In the
absence of physical limits and energetic tradeoffs, natural selection
would favor plants that could instantaneously adjust stomatal
conductance (\gsw) to perfectly track dynamic environmental conditions.
In reality, stomatal responses take time, creating a lag between actual
and optimal stomatal aperture. X ions must be pumped across \ldots{} and
active responses depend on multiple feedback loops involving gene
expression/ABA synthesis?/etc (Buckley). {[}illustrative empirical
example or real numbers illustrating the problem{]}. Changes in stomatal
aperture could be faster if there were more channels (?) per area, but
this would require more energy (ATP?) and space allocated to XX proteins
in the guard cell membrane.

It might seem that natural selection should favor faster stomatal
responses to get closer to the ideal of instantaneous optimization.
Under this assumption, variation in stomatal kinetics would depend on
how strong directional selection for faster responses is counterbalanced
by costs of faster stomata. We discuss multiple, nonmutually exclusive
costs below {[}WHERE?{]}. However, once models account for inevitable
time lags, natural selection can favor slower responses when this
prevents overreacting to unpredictable and shortlived changes in the
environment. {[}Review some lit{]} It is therefore likely that the
direction of selection on stomatal response rate varies depending on the
predictability and duration of environmental fluctuations, as well as
the energetic costs of stomatal movements.

What traits respond to selection on stomatal kinetics? We consider two
interconnected hypotheses that have thus far been treated in isolation.
The first hypothesis is that smaller guard cells open and close faster
because of their intrinsically greater surface area to volume ration (1,
2). For approximately cylindrical cell geometries, like that found in
guard cells (citation on guard cell shape?), surface area increases
linearly with radius, whereas volume increases in proportion to the
radius squared. Consequently, larger guard cells will require more time
to pump enough ions (wc?) to achieve a given change in turgor pressure
and, hence, stomatal pore aperture. A plant with large guard cells can
partially compensate for this geometric constraint by increasing the
density of transporters (wc?) in the guard cell membrane (3) (haworth et
al 2023 have some cites about this). However, this may be limited by the
available membrane area and/or energetic costs of maintaining high
transporter densities. Empirical support for the hypothesis that smaller
guard cells are faster is mixed. Some studies have found negative
correlations between guard cell size and stomatal response rate (1)
(cites), whereas others have found no relationship (cites). (apparently
hetherington and woodward 2003 mention size-speed relationship too -
check that. Lawson and Blatt 2014 throw shade on size being
deterministic)

One factor that might complicate the relationship between size and speed
is aperture. Stomatal aperture can vary from near 0 when guard cell
turgor pressure is low and asymptotically approach gmax as guard cell
turgor pressure approaches \(\infty\) (Figure 1X). The nonlinear
relationship between guard cell turgor and pore aperture implies that if
rate of change in turgor change is constant (\(\dv{P}{t} = C\)), the
rate of change in aperture, and hence stomatal conductance, will vary
depending on the initial aperture. When initial aperture is high,
stomatal conductance will respond more slowly than when initial aperture
is low. Since we generally do not observe individual stomatal aperture,
extending this idea to macroscale phenomena requires scaling by stomatal
density. We will use the term ``fraction of anatomical maximum stomatal
conductance'', symbolized as \fgmax. This value should be proportional
to the average aperture divided by its maximum aperture for any
arbitrary stomatal density {[}could a figure show how this interacts
with stomatal density?{]}. Leaves operating at fgmax closer to unity
will, all else being equal, will be slower to respond than leaves
operating with a \fgmax close to zero, independent of stomatal density.
(4) hypothesized that selection on stomatal density would maintain
typical operational stomatal conductance (gop) relative to gmax at a
sufficiently low value that stomatal conductance would be sensitive to
relatively small changes in guard cell turgor pressure. Consistent will
this hypothesis, gop:gmax is often near 0.25 (5, 6), well below
\(f_\text{gmax} = 1\), and in a range where \gsw would be responsive to
small changes in guard cell turgor pressure.

Putting these two hypotheses together, we predict that both guard cell
size and fgmax will influence stomatal kinetics, but possibly at
different scales of biological organization. Guard cell size tends to
vary less than stomatal density or aperture at many biological scales.
For example, on a mature leaf, guard cell size is essentially fixed
other than small changes in volume caused by turgor pressure (cite).
Compared to stomatal density, guard cell size is also less
developmentally plastic varies less genetically within species (cites).
If there is relatively little plastic or genetic variation among
individuals within a species, then most of the variance in stomatal
kinetics within species cannot be explained by variation in stomatal
size. In contrast, \fgmax varies immensely within and among individuals
because stomatal aperture responds dynamically over the day and in
response to environmental variation. Within a single leaf, \fgmax will
change over the course of a day in response to light signalling, change
in VPD, and starch accumulation (or sink strength? cite). During the
life a leaf, \fgmax will change in response to long-term stresses such
as drought. Because guard cell size and aperture typically vary at
different levels of biological organization, we predict that guard cell
size likely explains more variation in stomatal kinetics among species,
whereas \fgmax will explain more variation within species. Within
species variation can arise from either genetic or environmental
differences between individuals. Neither of these traits along will
determine all or even most of the variance in stomatal kinetics, which
is a complex response to many internal and external signals (cites).

Here we extend recent advances in phylogenetic comparative methods
(7--9) to test these predictions using data on stomatal closure kinetics
in response to an abrupt increase in VPD among 29 diverse wild tomato
populations in the genus \emph{Solanum}. We leveraged natural variation
in guard cell size among and within species to test whether leaves with
smaller guard cells close faster. We induced variation in fgmax through
a combination of growth and measurement light intensity. Growth light
intensity caused developmental plasticity in stomatal density that, when
crossed factorially with measurement light intensity, resulted in
variation in fgmax. By measuring multiple individuals from multiple
treatments across multiple species enabled us to estimate the effect of
guard cell size and \fgmax on stomatal kinetics and partition their
significance within and among species.

{[}not sure where this goes{]} many, large - slow because of large size,
but fast because of low gop few, small - slow because of high gop, but
fast because of small size some, moderate - best of both worlds? IDEA
FOR FIGURE - use empirical estimates to predict tau (z-axis) for a given
optimal gs as a function of

Is there a connection here to size-density scaling? It's an empirical
regularity, not a law of nature that higher gmax is associated with
smaller stomata. This is an observation that requires explanation, not a
presumption of truth.

What's never been done before is to put these two ideas together. This
means that weak relationships between size and speed might be because
people have not controlled for aperture (gop:gmax ratio).

Factors cannot also manifest at different scales of biological
organization. Here we focus on two levels: variation among species and
variation among individuals within species. To consider it abstractly,
if factors A and B influnce trait C according to some mechanistic model,
but factor A is typically fixed within species but varies among species,
then B will explain much of the variation in C within species. But if A
varies among species, then A will explain much of the variation in C
among species. We hypothesize that stomatal size is relatively constant
within species, but varies among species. In contrast, aperture
(gop:gmax) varies because of mismatches between leaf anatomy and gopt.

And that smaller stomata are faster.

These are related because the benefit of small stomata goes away if gop
is really high.

Phenomenologically, the following equation describes how stomatal
conductance responds to step changes in light intensity across dozens of
plant species (2):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-weibull}{
  g_\text{sw} = g_\text{f} + (g_\text{i} - g_\text{f}) e^{-\left(\frac{t}{\tau}\right)^\lambda}.
}\end{equation}

In this equation, \gsw is stomatal conductance at time \(t\),
\(g_\text{i}\) is the initial \gsw before the step change,
\(g_\text{f}\) is the final \gsw after the step change, \(\tau\) is a
time constant that describes how quickly stomata respond to the step
change, and \(\lambda\) is a shape parameter that describes how the
response rate changes over time. When \(\lambda = 1\), the response rate
is constant over time and \(\tau\) represents the time required for
\gsw to reach 36.8\% of the way between initial and final values. When
\(\lambda > 1\), the response rate increases over time, and when
\(\lambda < 1\), the response rate decreases over time. (2) refer to
\(\lambda\) as a lag-time parameter because empirically \(\lambda > 1\).
We find the same pattern for responses to a step change in VPD (see
results) and therefore adopt their terminology. We refer to stomatal
kinetic parameters \(\tau\) (time-constant) and \(\lambda\) (lag-time)
henceforth.

\subsection{Materials and Methods}\label{sec-methods}

\subsubsection{Populations and
phylogeny}\label{populations-and-phylogeny}

We analyzed stomatal responses to changing humidity among 29
ecologically diverse populations of wild tomato, including
representatives of all described species of \emph{Solanum} sect.
\emph{Lycopersicon} and sect. \emph{Lycopersicoides} (10) and the
cultivated tomato \emph{S. lycopersicum} var. \emph{lycopersicum}
(Table~\ref{tbl-populations}), as described in (11). These populations
were selected because they encompass the breadth of climatic variation
in the wild tomato clade (12). In one case, we substituted a congeneric
population of the species (\emph{S. galapagense}) because of difficulty
growing the focal population and we also added a population of \emph{S.
pennellii}. Due to constraints on growth space and time, we spread out
measurements over -Inf weeks from Inf to -Inf. Replicates within
population were evenly spread out over this period to prevent
confounding of temporal variation in growth conditions with variation
among populations. To estimate phylogenetic effects, we used the RAxML
whole-transcriptome concatenated phylogeny based on 2,745 100-kb genomic
windows from (12). Two of our populations were not in this tree. We used
accession LA1044 in place of LA3909, two populations of \emph{S.
galapagense}; LA0750 was added as sister to LA0716, two closely related
populations of \emph{S. pennellii}. The node separating LA0750 from
LA0716 was placed half-way between the next deepest node.

\subsubsection{Plant growth conditions and light
treatments}\label{plant-growth-conditions-and-light-treatments}

A thorough description of plant growth conditions can be found (11),
therefore we summarize the most important information here. Seeds
provided by the Tomato Genetics Resource Center germinated on moist
paper in plastic boxes after soaking for 30-60 minutes in a 50\% (volume
per volume) solution of household bleach and water, followed by a
thorough rinse. We transferred seedlings to cell-pack flats containing
Pro-Mix BX potting mix (Premier Tech, Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec, Canada)
once cotyledons fully emerged, typically within 1-2 weeks of sowing. We
grew seeds and seedlings for both sun and shade treatments under the
same environmental conditions (12:12 h,
24.3:\(\SI{21.7}{\degreeCelsius}\), 49.6:58.4 RH day:night cycle). LED
light provided
\(\mathrm{PPFD} = \SI{267}{\micro\mole\per\meter\squared\per\second}\)
(Fluence RAZRx, Austin, Texas, USA) during the germination and seedling
stages.

Immediately prior to starting growth light intensity treatments (sun and
shade), we transplanted seedlings to 3.78 L plastic pots containing 60\%
Pro-Mix BX potting mix, 20\% coral sand (Pro-Pak, Honolulu, Hawaiʻi,
USA), and 20\% cinders (Niu Nursery, Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, USA) withslow
release NPK fertilizer following manufacturer instructions (Osmocote
Smart-Release Plant Food Flower \& Vegetable, The Scotts Company,
Marysville, Ohio, USA). Percentage composition is on a volume basis. We
watered to field capacity three times per week to prevent drought
stress. Seedlings were randomly assigned in alternating order within
population to the sun or shade treatment during transplanting. The
average daytime \ppfd{} was \ppfdqty{761} and \ppfdqty{115} for sun and
shade treatments, respectively.

\subsubsection{Humidity response curves}\label{humidity-response-curves}

We selected a fully expanded, unshaded leaf at least six leaves above
the cotyledons during early vegetative growth. This typically meant that
plants had grown in light treatments for \(\approx\) 4 weeks, ensuring
they had time to sense and respond developmentally to the light
intensity of the treatment rather than the seedling conditions (13). See
(11) for further detail.

To measure stomatal responses to a step change in humidity, we first
acclimated the focal leaf to high humidity, rapidly decreased the
humidity, and logged \gsw through time. We refer to this as a
humidity-response curve. We measured humidity-response curves using a
portable infrared gas analyzer (LI-6800PF, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln,
Nebraska, USA). Light-acclimated plants were placed under LEDs dimmed to
match their light treatment during gas exchange measurements. We
estimated \gsw at ambient CO\(_2\) (\caequals{415}) and
\tleafequals{25.0}.

We collected four humidity-response curves per leaf, an amphi
(untreated) curve and a pseudohypo (treated) curve at high
light-intensity (\ppfdequals{2000}; 97.8:2.24 red:blue) and low
light-intensity (\ppfdequals{150}; 87.0:13.0 red:blue). We always
measured high light-intensity curves first because photosynthetic
downregulation is faster than upregulation in these species.
Pseudohypostomatous leaves are the same as the amphistomatous leaves
except gas exchange through the upper (adaxial) surface blocked by a
neutral density plastic (propafilm). Comparing amphi and pseudohypo
curves on the same leaf enables us to test whether stomatal kinetics are
different for ab- and adaxial stomata on the same leaf. To compensate
for reduced transmission, we increased incident \ppfd{} for pseudohypo
leaves by a factor 1/0.91, the inverse of the measured transmissivity of
the propafilm. We also set the stomatal conductance ratio, for purposes
of calculating boundary layer conductance, to 0 for pseudohypo leaves
following manufacturer directions.

To control for order effects, we alternated between starting with amphi
or pseudohypo leaf measurements. We made measurements over two days. On
the first day, we measured high and low light-intensity curves for
either amphi or pseudohypo leaves; on the second day, we measured high
and low light-intensity curves on the other leaf type. The irradiance of
the light source in the pseudohypo leaf was higher because the propafilm
reduces transmission.

In all cases, we acclimated the focal leaf to high light
(\ppfdequals{2000}) and high relative humidity (\rhequals{70}) until
\gsw{} reached its maximum. After that, we scrubbed water vapor from the
incoming air using silica desiccant as quickly as possible, resulting in
a water vapor concentration in the incoming air to be on average
\(\SI{0.36}{\milli\mol\per\mol}\). This treatment induced rapid stomatal
closure, but it did not standardize chamber air humidity because water
vapor was introduced by leaf transpiration. HOWEVER - NO RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN FINAL GSW AND TAU (fill in details). This treatment was designed
to elicit a rapid stomatal response and not necessarily mimic natural
environmental variability. All other environmental conditions in the
leaf chamber remained the same. We started logging data after the
transient ``wrong-way response'' (citation) and continued logging data
until \gsw{} reached its nadir. We then acclimated the leaf to low light
(\ppfdequals{150}) and \rhequals{70} before inducing stomatal closure
with low \rh{} and logging data as described above.

Prior to analysis, we removed unreliable and unusable data points,
removed points not at instrument steady state, removed hysteretic
portion of each curves at low \gsw{}, removed outliers within each
curve, removed replicates with no overlap between amphi and pseudohypo
curves from the same leaf, and thinned redundant data points within each
curve. The rationale and procedure for each cleaning step is described
in (11). Additionally, we excluded stomatal kinetic parameter estimates
from 4 curves where \(\tau\) was estimated to be greater than 1097 s,
greatly exceeding the typical estimates (see Results). After these
steps, the total number of humidity response curves analyzed is given in
Table~\ref{tbl-sample-size}. The median number of curves per population
per treatment was 10 and the median number of points per curve was 26.
We extracted the the posterior distribution for \(\tau\) and \(\lambda\)
from each fitted curve to calculate the parameter estimate (median) and
uncertainty (standard deviation) for subsequent analyses.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Stomatal anatomical traits \gcl and
\fgmax}{Stomatal anatomical traits and }}\label{stomatal-anatomical-traits-and}

We estimated the stomatal density and \gcl{} on ab- and adaxial surfaces
from all leaves used for humidity response curves. We used standard
methods describe fully in (11). For each surface we calculated the
anatomical maximum stomatal conductance (\gmax) at a reference leaf
temperature of \(\SI{25}{\degreeCelsius}\) following (14) as:

\[g_\mathrm{max} = b m d l_\mathrm{gc} / \sqrt{2}.\] The biophysical and
morphological constants \(b\) and \(m\) are:

\[b = \frac{D_\mathrm{wv}}{v},~\text{and}\]
\[m = \frac{\pi c ^ 2}{j^{0.5} (4 h j + \pi c)},\]

where \(D_\mathrm{wv}\) is the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in
air and \(v\) is by the kinematic viscosity of dry air. We assumed
\(D_\mathrm{wv} = \SI{2.49e-5}{\meter\squared\per\second}\) and
\(v = \SI{2.24e-2}{\raiseto{3}\meter\per\mol}\) (15). For kidney-shaped
guard cells like those in wild tomatoes, \(c = h = j = 0.5\). The
\gmaxratio{} is the \gmax{} of the adaxial surface divided by the sum
total \gmax{} of both surfaces. To estimate \fgmax, we divided the
initial \gsw{} estimated from the parameter \(g_\text{i}\) in
Equation~\ref{eq-weibull} from each humidity response curve the
anatomical \gmax{} for that leaf. The estimated \(g_\text{i}\) was very
close to the maximum \gsw{} observed near the beginning of each curve
(Figure~\ref{fig-compare-gsw}), suggesting that the initial \gsw{} was a
good proxy for operational stomatal conductance at the time of the step
change in humidity. We used the anatomical \gmax{} for the surface(s)
measured in each curve to calculate \fgmax. For amphi curves, we used
the sum of adaxial and abaxial \gmax{}; for pseudohypo curves, we used
only the abaxial \gmax{}.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis generation and
testing}\label{hypothesis-generation-and-testing}

The primary aims and \emph{a priori} hypotheses of this study were not
to study stomatal kinetic parameters and are described in (11). The idea
to use \gsw response curves generated during this study to test
hypotheses about which traits influence stomatal kinetics came after the
data had been collected, but not yet analyzed for this purpose. Before
analyzing the data, we planned to test two hypotheses based on a recent
metaanalysis of stomatal responses to light (2). We hypothesized that 1)
guard cell size would influence \(\tau\) and 2) that \(\tau\) would be
greater on the abaxial-only leaves. We planned to compare relationships
within and among populations using phylogenetic comparative methods. We
made the decision to test for an association between \fgmax and \(\tau\)
after exploratory analyses revealed a potential association. Adding
hypotheses after some results have been analyzed, also known as
``Hypothesizing After Results Known'' (HARKing), can lead to reports of
spurious associations that are not repeatable in later studies (16, 17).
Therefore, our conclusions about the effect of \fgmax on stomatal
kinetics should be interpreted with caution until they are replicated.

We estimated \(\tau\) and \(\lambda\) for each response curve by fitting
Equation~\ref{eq-weibull} to a time-series of \gsw{} values using
Bayesian nonlinear regression. All models were fit using a Bayesian HMC
sampling in the probabilistic programming language \emph{Stan} (18)
using the \emph{R} package \textbf{brms} version 2.23.0 (19). We used
\emph{CmdStan} version 2.38.0 and \textbf{cmdstanr} version 0.9.0 (20)
to interface with \emph{R} version 4.5.2 (21). We sampled 1000
post-warmup draws from the posterior distribution on a single chain. We
adjusted the number sampling iterations and thinning interval for each
curve so that the Gelman-Rubin convergence statistic (\(\hat{R}\)) (22)
was less than 1.05 and the bulk effective sample size (ESS) was greater
than 400 for all model parameters, and there were fewer than 10
divergent transitions. We assessed model fit using Bayesian \(R^2\) (23)
implemented in \textbf{brms}.

We next used estimates of \(\tau\) from each curve in multiresponse
Bayesian mixed effects models with phylogenetically structured random
effects to answer the following core questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Are \gcl{} and \fgmax{} positively associated with \(\tau\)?
\item
  At what biological levels of organization do \gcl{} and \fgmax{}
  influence \(\tau\)?
\item
  Are abaxial-only stomatal responses slower than whole leaf stomatal
  responses?
\end{enumerate}

We used a combination of model selection and parameter estimation to
evaluate these hypotheses. All statistical models included fixed effects
of manipulative treatments: growth light intensity (sun and shade);
measurement light intensity (high and low); and curve type
(amphistomatous and pseudohypostomatous). All models also included
population as both a phylogenetically structured random effect and a
non-phylogenetic random effect following (9). Prior to fitting, the
phylogenetic (co)variance matrix was rescaled as a correlation matrix
(24). For traits measured multiple times within the same leaf (\fgmax,
\(\lambda\), \(\tau\)) we included a random effect of individual to
account for repeated measures. We accounted for uncertainty in \(\tau\)
and \(\lambda\) using the standard deviation of the posterior
distribution of each estimate (see `Humidity response curves' for
details). We modeled residual (co)variance, a combination
among-individual (co)variance and measurement error, as a multivariate
Student \(t\)-distribution, which is more robust to extreme values than
the multivariate normal distribution (25). To account for
heteroskedasticity, bounded measurements, and linearize relationships,
\gcl, \(\lambda\), and \(\tau\) were log-transformed prior to analysis
whereas \fgmax{} was logit-transformed. All models were fit with
\emph{Stan} following the same methods described above for fitting
Equation~\ref{eq-weibull} to the humidity response curves.

To answer questions 1 and 2 above, we analyzed three nonmutually
exclusive paths through which \fgmax{} and \gcl{} could influence
stomatal kinetic parameters \(\lambda\) and \(\tau\). First, we inferred
phylogenetic effects by estimating the phylogenetic correlation among
populations between anatomical (\fgmax{} and \gcl{}) and kinetic
(\(\lambda\) and \(\tau\)) variables. To test for possible causation, we
used the inferred phylogenetic trait covariance matrix to estimate
partial correlations between anatomical and kinetic variables (9). We
interpret a significant partial correlation between variables as a
plausible causal hypothesis. Second, we inferred individual-level
effects of \fgmax{} and \gcl{} on kinetic parameters using linear
multiple regression that simultaneously accounts for phylogenetic and
treatment effects. We used the leave-one-out cross-validation
information criterion (LOOIC) to compare the fit of models using the
\emph{R} package \textbf{loo} version 2.9.0 (26) to calculate LOOIC
values. We compared models with all permutations of \fgmax{} and \gcl{}
influencing \(\lambda\) and \(\tau\). We considered all models within
two \(\Delta\)LOOIC standard errors of the minimum LOOIC
(Table~\ref{tbl-comparison}) to be in the set of plausible models to
generate posterior predictions for hypothesis testing. Within each
plausible model, we assessed whether an effect was significantly
different from zero based on the 95\% confidence intervals. Third, we
used causal mediation analysis (\textbf{pearl\_causality\_2022?}) to
test whether plasticity in \(\tau\) was mediated by plasticity in
\fgmax{} or \gcl{} in response to measurement light intensity, growth
light intensity, and curve-type treatments. We inferred the direct
effect of treatments on \(\tau\) from model coefficients. We estimated
the mediated effect of treatments using the product of the effect of
treatment on mediator (\fgmax{} or \gcl) and the effect of the mediator
on \(\tau\). We determibed significant direct and mediator effects based
on whether the 95\% confidence intervals of the effects were different
from zero.

\subsubsection{Variance decomposition and heritability
(somewhere)}\label{variance-decomposition-and-heritability-somewhere}

We decomposed the variance in log-transformed response variables
(\(\lambda\), \(tau\), \fgmax, \gcl) into phylogenetic, population,
between-individual, and within-individual levels. The phylogenetic
variance component quantifies trait evolution between populations
congruent with the phylogenetic relationships, whereas the population
component quantifies variance among populations independent of
phylogenetic relationships (24, 27). The between- and within-individual
variance components quantify variance among individuals within the same
population and treatment. The within-individual component was estimated
from repeated measures of the same leaf at different light intensities.
It was not possible to estimate within-individual variance in guard cell
length with our study design because we only measured average guard cell
length once per leaf. We estimated the between-individual variance from
the residual variance, which also includes measurement error. The
phylogenetic heritability is equivalent to the phylogenetic variance
component and is estimated following (27); (24) as:

\[h^2_{\mathrm{phy}} = \frac{\sigma^2_\mathrm{phy}}{\sigma^2_\mathrm{phy} + \sigma^2_\mathrm{pop} + \sigma^2_\mathrm{between} + \sigma^2_\mathrm{within}},\]

where \(\sigma^2_\mathrm{phy}\), \(\sigma^2_\mathrm{pop}\),
\(\sigma^2_\mathrm{between}\), and \(\sigma^2_\mathrm{within}\) are the
phylogenetic, population, between-individual, and within-individual
variance components, respectively.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{The time-constant \(\tau\) characterizes
stomatal
kinetics}{The time-constant \textbackslash tau characterizes stomatal kinetics}}\label{the-time-constant-tau-characterizes-stomatal-kinetics}

Stomatal conductance (\gsw) decreased rapidly in response to a step
change in humidity. The model in Equation~\ref{eq-weibull} fit the data
extremely well (Figure~\ref{fig-rh-curves}). The mean and minimum
Bayesian \(R^2\) across all curves was 0.9994 and 0.9802, respectively.
Consider a typical leaf in the experiment characterized by the median
time constant (\(\tau\)) and lag time (\(\lambda\)) among wild tomato
accessions in all treatments. After humidity decreased and the transient
wrong way response elapsed, it took 121 s for \gsw to decrease half-way
(\(t_{50}\)) from its initial (\(g_\text{i}\)) to final
((\(g_\text{f}\)) steady state value. In terms of the kinetic model
parameters, most variation among leaves was due to difference in the
time constant rather than the lag time. In the previous example,
increasing \(\lambda\) from its median to its maximum estimated value
among accessions increased the \(t_{50}\) by only 8.2 s. In contrast,
increasing \(\tau\) from its median to maximum value increased
\(t_{50}\) by 129 s. Hence, we primarily focus on treatments and
anatomical parameters affect \(\tau\).

\subsubsection{Effects of light intensity treatments on guard cell
length and
aperture}\label{effects-of-light-intensity-treatments-on-guard-cell-length-and-aperture}

On average, guard cell length increased by \(12.1\)\% {[}95\% CI:
\(11.2\) to \(13.1\)\%{]} in the sun treatment
(Figure~\ref{fig-accession-anatomy}a; Table~\ref{tbl-fit}). The average
\gcl{} of pseudohypo leaves was \(-5.9\)\% {[}95\% CI: \(-6.7\) to
\(-5.1\)\%{]} greater than amphi leaves
(Figure~\ref{fig-accession-anatomy}a; Table~\ref{tbl-fit}). This was not
because of plasticity because we amphi and pseudohypo curves on the same
leaf. Rather, this was a composition effect. Adaxial stomata tended to
be slightly smaller than abaxial stomata, so the average \gcl{} in
pseudohypo leaves was slightly higher than in amphi leaves because the
former only included abaxial stomata. High measurement light intensity
increased \fgmax by an average of \(0.84\) logit units {[}95\% CI:
\(0.82\) to \(0.87\){]} (Figure~\ref{fig-accession-anatomy}b;
Table~\ref{tbl-fit}). For example, if \(f_\text{gmax} = 0.1\) in low
light, the typical \fgmax{} for the same leaf acclimated to high light
was 0.21. Sun leaves had on average \(-0.28\) logit units {[}95\% CI:
\(-0.35\) to \(-0.21\){]} lower \fgmax{} than shade-grown plants
(Figure~\ref{fig-accession-anatomy}b; Table~\ref{tbl-fit}). Treated
pseudohypo leaves had on average \(0.21\) logit units {[}95\% CI:
\(0.18\) to \(0.24\){]} higher \fgmax{} than untreated, amphistomatous
leaves (Figure~\ref{fig-accession-anatomy}b; Table~\ref{tbl-fit}). This
indicates that stomatal aperture was more open in leaves where gas
exchange through adaxial stomata was blocked.

In both panels, black points are mean trait value per population within

populations, but developmental plasticity to growth light intensity
tends to increase \gcl in sun (left facet) compared to shade (right

vs.~pseudohypo), but the average \gcl{} is slightly high in pseudohypo
leaves because abaxial stomata tended to be larger than adaxial stomata
on the same leaf. (b) Measurement light intensity has the most direct
effect on \fgmax{} because stomatal aperture increases under high light
intensity. To a lesser extent, \fgmax varies among populations and is
slightly lower in sun-grown plants. ADD RESULTS ON EFFECT OF CURVE

\(\tau\)}{Effects of light intensity treatments on \textbackslash tau}}\label{effects-of-light-intensity-treatments-on-tau}

Growth light intensity did not significantly affect \(\tau\)
Figure~\ref{fig-accession-kinetics}. In sun plants, \(\tau\) was on
average 5.64\% {[}95\% CI: 1.03 to 10.6\%{]} lower than in shade plants
after accounting for other explanatory variables. Within the same leaf,
increasing the measurement light intensity prior to the humidity step
change from \ppfdqty{150} to \ppfdqty{2000} significantly increased
\(\tau\) by 18.3\% {[}95\% CI: 11.8 to 25\%{]}

to growth, but not measurement light intensity after accounting for
other explanatory variables Figure~\ref{fig-accession-kinetics}. In sun
plants, \(\tau\) was on average 12.2\% {[}95\% CI: 10.2 to 14.2\%{]}
greater than in shade plants. Higher measurement light decreased
increased \(\lambda\) slightly by 1.2\% {[}95\% CI: -1.07 to 3.56\%{]}.

\subsubsection{Variance decomposition and phylogenetic
heritability}\label{variance-decomposition-and-phylogenetic-heritability}

Among the four traits in our model (\fgmax, \gcl, \(\lambda\), and
\(\tau\)), the preponderance of the variance was typically within or
between individuals after accounting for treatment effects
Figure~\ref{fig-variance}, Table~\ref{tbl-variance}. The exception to
this pattern was \gcl{}, for which the phylogenetic component (aka
phylogenetic heritability) was larger Figure~\ref{fig-variance}. The
population component independent of phylogeny explained little of the
trait variation. The between-individual variance was usually high, but
this component confounds true between-individual variance with
measurement error, so should be interpreted with caution.

Guard cell size and \fgmax affected stomatal kinetics, but at different
levels of biological organization. In the model with the lowest LOOIC
(see Table~\ref{tbl-comparison} for model comparison results), the only
significant partial correlation was between \gcl and \(\tau\)
(\(\rho = 0.74\) {[}95\% CI: -0.12 to 0.98\$) was a significant
phylogenetic correlation between \gcl and \(\tau\) (\textbf{fig?}-?).
PARTIAL CORRELATION RESULT. Variation in \gcl within populations did not
explain within-population variation in \(\tau\) Table~\ref{tbl-fit}.
NOTE THAT BEST MODEL RETAINED INDIVIDUAL LEVEL EFFECT OF GCL, BUT
COEFFICIENT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. OTHER BEST MODELS DID NOT RETAIN THIS.
DID GCL MEDIATE AFFECT OF TREATMENTS?

Need to show (this is a growing, incomplete list): - phylogenetic
partial correlation - partial correlation showing that gcl and tau are
(only?) significant phylogenetic covariates

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Stomatal aperture mediates plasticity in
\(\tau\)}{Stomatal aperture mediates plasticity in \textbackslash tau}}\label{stomatal-aperture-mediates-plasticity-in-tau}

We imposed three treatments that influenced stomatal kinetics: growth
light intensity, measurement light intensity, and curve type. We found
that the effect of measurement light intensity on \(\tau\) was mediated
by \fgmax. (Figure~\ref{fig-mediation}).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{../figures/mediation.pdf}}

}

\caption{\label{fig-mediation}\textbf{Stomatal aperture as a fraction of anatomical maximum stomatal conductance (\fgmax) mediates plasticity in the time constant $\tau$.}
The three treatments are curve type (top facet; amphi vs.~pseudohypo),
growth light intensity (middle facet; shade vs.~sun), and measurement
light intensity (bottom facet; low vs.~high). Horizontal arrows at the
bottom of each graph indicate the direct effect of the treatment level
on \(\tau\); slanted arrows leading to or from \fgmax{} indicate
mediated effects of the treatment on \(\tau\). Line thickness is
proportional to the effect size and line color indicates whether the
effects are negative (red) positive (blue). Parameter estimates of the
effect and 95\% confidence intervals are above each line. Note that are
not consistent because \fgmax is on a logit scale whereas \(\tau\) is on
a log-seconds scale. The selected model did not retain direct effeects
of \gcl{} on \(\tau\) and hence this variable could not be considered as
a mediator.}

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

effect of fgmax is not simply because high light intensity increased
fgmax and tau. Causal inference dissects different causal paths and
shows direct effect of fgmax on tau within populations and treatments

caveat: this treatment is a hammer than exposes maximum rate of stomatal
closure. The factors which influence this may not explain variance in
kinetics in more natural conditions.

\subsection{MANUSCRAPS}\label{manuscraps}

Note: this theory did not really pan out. It did not come up with models
that really fit better than the CD Weibull model and they included an
extra parameter. Therefore, I am tabling this for now and trying
OnGuard3 instead.

\subsubsection{Theory}\label{theory}

Our goal here is derive equations that integrate the effects of guard
cell size and aperture on stomatal kinetics. A fully mechanistic model
is beyond the scope of our goals here. Instead, we use phenomenological
equations that adequately capture empirical patterns. There are three
main assumptions of our model. First, we assume linear relaxation
kinetics for guard cell turgor pressure (\(P\)):

\[ \frac{d P}{d t} = \frac{P^* - P}{\tau}.\] In this differential
equation, \(P^*\) is the equilibrium turgor pressure and \(\tau\) is a
time constant that determines the speed of relaxation. Solving this
equation gives:

\[ P(t) = P^* + [P(0) - P^*] e^{-t/\tau}, \] where \(P(0)\) is the
initial turgor pressure at time \(t=0\).

The rate of relaxation is determined by the surface area to volume
ratio. Assume constant transport per surface area. Surface area
determined by geometry.

What is eqn for this?
