## Abstract

Guard cell size and stomatal density vary over X and X orders of magnitude among extant vascular land plants, yet the adaptive significance of much of this variation remains unclear. The evolution of guard cell size in particular is poorly understood and may even be constrained by nonadaptive features like genome size. One hypothesis is that natural selection may favor smaller guard cells to increase the rate at which stomatal conductance responds to fluctuating environmental conditions. A related hypothesis is that operational stomatal conductance (gop) is often $\approx 25\%$ of its theoretical maximum (gmax) because at this stomatal aperture, guard cell volume is poised to change rapidly with changes in turgor pressure. The support for both hypothesis is limited and mixed, in part because they have not been tested together, even though both guard cell size and the ratio of gop to gmax (gop:gmax) should influence stomatal kinetics. We measured stomatal closure kinetics in response to an abrupt increase in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) among 29 diverse wild tomato populations in the genus \textit{Solanum}. Both smaller guard cell size and lower gop:gmax were associated with faster stomatal closure kinetics, but at different levels of biological organization. Guard cell size explained X% of the variance in stomatal kinetics among populations, whereas gop:gmax explained X% of the variance among individuals within populations. [neither result would have been supported if analyzed in isolation - is this true?]. We conclude that guard cell size may respond to selection on stomatal kinetics over evolutionary time, but actual kinetics are modulated by a tradeoff between maximizing gop and minimizing the time required for stomatal closure. Putting these hypotheses together with stabilizing selection on gop may explain why stomatal size and density negatively covary among species.
