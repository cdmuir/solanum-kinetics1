hooks:

argument that closure rate is constant (requires a hysteresis)

argument that stomatal size controls kinetics (only once you control for levels)

Haworth et al (2018) paper arguing faster adaxial kinetics (I think). Check other cites in Woning and Horak

## Introduction

Stomatal kinetics are important for optimizing response to rapid fluctuations in light, leaf temperture, and VPD

curve shape does not match what you'd expect for constant alpha term

Anatomy possibly matters: shape and size

Adaxial stomata might close faster (why?)

What we did:\
1. model stomatal close with hysteresis (can it explain overshoot and wrong-way response?

2.  compare tau in tomatoes to that in rice
3.  test for effect of size
4.  test if adaxial+abaxial is faster than abaxial alone
