## Introduction

In nature, change is the only constant. One way that vascular plants (tracheophytes) cope with change is by adjusting stomatal pore aperture to optimize the trade-off between carbon gain and water loss. In the absence of physical limits and energentic tradeoffs, stomatal conductance (gsw) would respond instantaneously to perfectly track dynamic environmental conditions. In reality, stomatal responses take time. X ions must be pumped across ... and active responses depend on multiple feedback loops involving gene expression/ABA synthesis?/etc (Buckley). [illustrative empirical example or real numbers illustrating the problem]. Changes in stomatal aperture could be faster if there were more channels (?) per area, but this would require more energy (ATP?) and space in the guard cell membrane. 

At first it might seem that natural selection should always favor faster stomatal responses to get closer to the ideal of instantaneous optimization. However, once you account for time lags and tradeoffs, it is less clear that faster is always better. Review some lit...

There are two related hypotheses about how leaves might ... Two major hypotheses that are related but not well connected. One hypothesis is that smaller stomata are speedier. Explain why. Evidence is mixed. 

One factor that might complicate the relationship between size and speed is aperture. As gop approaches gmax, large changes in turbot are required to make small changes in a. Over the long-term, selection optimizes gop:gmax ratio (Franks et al. 2012). What's evidence or progress on this?


Is there a connection here to size-density scaling? It’s an empirical regularity, not a law of nature that higher gmax is associated with smaller stomata. This is an observation that requires explanation, not a presumption of truth. 

What's never been done before is to put these two ideas together. This means that weak relationships between size and speed might be because people have not controlled for aperture (gop:gmax ratio).

Factors cannot also manifest at different scales of biological organization. Here we focus on two levels: variation among species and variation among individuals within species. To consider it abstractly, if factors A and B influnce trait C according to some mechanistic model, but factor A is typically fixed within species but varies among species, then B will explain much of the variation in C within species. But if A varies among species, then A will explain much of the variation in C among species. We hypothesize that stomatal size is relatively constant within species, but varies among species.  In contrast, aperture (gop:gmax) varies because of mismatches between leaf anatomy and gopt.


And that smaller stomata are faster.

These are related because the benefit of small stomata goes away if gop is really high.



hooks:

argument that closure rate is constant (requires a hysteresis)

argument that stomatal size controls kinetics (only once you control for levels)

Haworth et al (2018) paper arguing faster adaxial kinetics (I think). Check other cites in Woning and Horak




Stomatal kinetics are important for optimizing response to rapid fluctuations in light, leaf temperture, and VPD

curve shape does not match what you'd expect for constant alpha term

Anatomy possibly matters: shape and size

Adaxial stomata might close faster (why?)

What we did:\
1. model stomatal close with hysteresis (can it explain overshoot and wrong-way response?

2.  compare tau in tomatoes to that in rice
3.  test for effect of size
4.  test if adaxial+abaxial is faster than abaxial alone
