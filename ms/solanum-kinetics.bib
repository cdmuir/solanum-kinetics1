The balance between these two processes depends on stomatal responses to environmental and internal cues and the synchrony of stomatal behavior relative to mesophyll demands for CO2. Here we examine the rapidity of stomatal responses with attention to their relationship to photosynthetic CO2 uptake and the consequences for water use. We discuss the influence of anatomical characteristics on the velocity of changes in stomatal conductance and explore the potential for manipulating the physical as well as physiological characteristics of stomatal guard cells in order to accelerate stomatal movements in synchrony with mesophyll CO2 demand and to improve water use efficiency without substantial cost to photosynthetic carbon fixation. We conclude that manipulating guard cell transport and metabolism is just as, if not more likely to yield useful benefits as manipulations of their physical and anatomical characteristics. Achieving these benefits should be greatly facilitated by quantitative systems analysis that connects directly the molecular properties of the guard cells to their function in the field.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the relative contribution of functional and developmental constraints on phenotypic variation is a long-standing goal of macroevolution, but it is often difficult to distinguish different types of constraints. Alternatively, selection can limit phenotypic (co)variation if some trait combinations are generally maladaptive. The anatomy of leaves with stomata on both surfaces (amphistomatous) present a unique opportunity to test the importance of functional and developmental constraints on phenotypic evolution. The key insight is that stomata on each leaf surface encounter the same functional and developmental constraints but potentially different selective pressures because of leaf asymmetry in light capture, gas exchange, and other features. Independent evolution of stomatal traits on each surface imply that functional and developmental constraints alone likely do not explain trait covariance. Packing limits on how many stomata can fit into a finite epidermis and cell size–mediated developmental integration are hypothesized to constrain variation in stomatal anatomy. The simple geometry of the planar leaf surface and knowledge of stomatal development make it possible to derive equations for phenotypic (co)variance caused by these constraints and compare them with data. We analyzed evolutionary covariance between stomatal density and length in amphistomatous leaves from 236 phylogenetically independent contrasts using a robust Bayesian model. Stomatal anatomy on each surface diverges partially independently, meaning that packing limits and developmental integration are not sufficient to explain phenotypic (co)variation. Hence, (co)variation in ecologically important traits like stomata arises in part because there is a limited range of evolutionary optima. We show how it is possible to evaluate the contribution of different constraints by deriving expected patterns of (co)variance and testing them using similar but separate tissues, organs, or sexes.},

                  Correlation across species between two quantitative traits, or between a trait and a habitat property, can suggest that a trait value is effective in sustaining populations in some contexts but not others. It is widely held that such correlations should be controlled for phylogeny, via phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) or phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS).
                
                
                  A weakness of this idea is that a clade's traits tend to confer success in particular habitats or ways of life, and those niches in turn tend to select for the same traits to continue in the clade. This feedback mechanism can bind phylogeny and niche together as a unified cause for present‐day trait configurations. Accordingly, the phylogenetically conservative share of a trait correlation ought not to be excluded from consideration as potentially ecologically functional.
                
                
                  Another weakness is that PGLS does not yield a complete or accurate breakdown of covariation between traits A and B because it corresponds to a generating model where B predicts variation in A but not the reverse, and phylogenetic signal in B is not modelled.
                
                
                  Multi‐response mixed models using phylogenetic covariance matrices can quantify conservative trait correlation (CTC), a share of A‐B covariation that is phylogenetically conservative. Because the evidence is from correlative data, it is not possible to split CTC into causation by phylogenetic history versus causation by continuing reciprocal selection between A and B. Moreover, it is quite likely biologically that the two influences have acted in concert, through phylogenetic niche conservatism.

              The scale and resolution of trait databases and molecular phylogenies is increasing rapidly. These resources permit many open questions in comparative biology to be addressed with the right statistical tools. Multi‐response (MR) phylogenetic mixed models (PMMs) offer great potential for multivariate analyses of trait evolution. While flexible and powerful, these methods are not often employed by researchers in ecology and evolution, reflecting a specialised and technical literature that creates barriers to usage for many biologists. Here we present a practical and accessible guide to MR‐PMMs. We begin with a review of single‐response (SR) PMMs to introduce key concepts and outline the limitations of this approach for characterising patterns of trait coevolution. We emphasise MR‐PMMs as a preferable approach for analyses involving multiple species traits, due to the explicit decomposition of trait covariances. We discuss multilevel models, multivariate models of evolution, and extensions to non‐Gaussian response traits. We highlight techniques for causal inference using graphical models, as well as advanced topics including prior specification and latent factor models. Using simulated data and visual examples, we discuss interpretation, prediction, and model validation. We implement many of the techniques discussed in example analyses of plant functional traits to demonstrate the general utility of MR‐PMMs in handling complex real‐world data sets. Finally, we discuss the emerging synthesis of comparative techniques made possible by MR‐PMMs, highlight strengths and weaknesses, and offer practical recommendations to analysts. To complement this material, we provide online tutorials including side‐by‐side model implementations in two popular R packages,
              MCMCglmm

Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},
